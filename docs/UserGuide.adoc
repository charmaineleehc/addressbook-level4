== Introduction

CarviciM is a desktop application for those who *need to manage a great number of car servicing jobs*. More importantly, CarviciM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CarviciM can get your management of servicing jobs done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.

.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CarviciM.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
